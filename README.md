<h1>Two ways to confirm the ending of a string with JavaScript</h1>

Check if a `string` (first argument, str) ends with the given `target` string (second argument, target).

1. using the substr() method
2. using endsWith() method

<h3>substr()</h3>
The substr() method returns the characters in a string beginning at the specified location through the specified number of characters.
Example substr(1, 4)
If the target.length is negative, the substr() method will start the counting from the end of the string.

<h3>endsWith()</h3>
The endsWith() method determines whether a string ends with the characters of another string, returning `true` or `false` as appropriate. 
This method is case-sensitive.
